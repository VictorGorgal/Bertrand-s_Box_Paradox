# Bertrand's Box Paradox

Inspired by: youtu.be/ytfCdqWhmdg

The Bertrand Box Paradox consists of 3 boxes, one containing 2 gold coins, one containing 2 silver coins, and another box containing one of each.  
After the first coin is withdrawn, if it is a gold coin, what is the chance that the next coin will also be gold?

At first it may seem that after the first coin is gold, the second one will have a 50% chance of also being gold, but in reality the real chance is 2/3 of the time the second coin will be gold and 1/3 of the time it will be silver.  
The algorithm is intended to simulate and show the percentage of 10_000 games.
